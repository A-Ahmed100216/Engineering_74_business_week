# Critical Thinking
## Why?
* Create strong arguments by justifying your claims with evidence you have gathered and evaluated
* Can contribute to any role as it requires the ability to gather info, analyse and evaluate it. 
* Get to the truth- not just trying to win an argument but get to the bottom.
## Key Skills
* Seek out all sides of an argument;
* Check facts and evidence;
* Respond objectively.
## Levels of intellectual skills
* Evaluate – Weigh out both sides and make a decision
* Synthesise – Combine the information and ideas into something new.
* Analyse – Determine the impact.
* Apply – Use knowledge to solve problems.
* Understand – Understand the information.
* Remember- Recall information.
## The Critical Thinking Process
1. Identify:
...The main points of the argument; 
The claims being made;
Evidence used;
Conclusions reached. 
2. Analyse:
...Does the information make sense in relation to research;
How old is the material;
Is the material clear or do you need to find additional information to aid understanding;
Does the argument present a balanced view or are some topics disregarded? 
3. Apply:
...The implications of other information;
Weaknesses of your argument when applied to real-life situations;
A lack of coverage- Ensure you have covered all the content. 

## Modes of Thinking
There are three mode of thinking:
* Divergent - This focusses upon the question at hand and generates ideas to tackle this. Imagination is at the heart of this mindset.
* Convergent - This focusses upon the facts to present an answer. Logic is at the heart of this mindset.
* Lateral - This is a mixture of both convergent and divergent thinking to achive the best of both worlds and find solutions which are both imaginative and logical.
The thinking hats can also be applied in a critical thinking aspect. To recap:
* White = Facts 
* Yellow = Optimism 
* Black = Judgement
* Red = Emotions
* Green = Creativity
* Blue = Thinking
Conversely, there are incorrect attitudes which prevent us from embracing critical thinking. These are:
1. Ignorant Certainty - The belief that there are definite answers to all questions.
2. Naïve realism- The belief that there is no truth and all arguments are equal.

## What is Enquiry-Based Learning?
* This is the practice of learning by asking questions. 
* Questions can either be open or closed questions:
..* Open - gives the respondant much more freedom in how they respond. Typically, open questions begin with 'how','why','when' etc. 
..* Closed - directs the respondant towards a certain answer. Typically, such questions have a 'yes' or 'no' response. 
The process can be summed up in the following diagram.

## Debating 
### Things to consider
* What is the source of evidence?
* What claims are being made?
Has evidence been provided?
* Is the argument balanced - Strength and weakness?
* Are the points clear and concise?
* What are the underlying themes and background/context?
* Is the argument supported with good examples - Real or imagined examples?
### Structure
The Point, Evidence, Conclusion structure is advised.
1. Point - Present your argument in a clear statement.
2. Evidence - Present evidence to support your claim.
3. Impact - Explain significance of evidence, how does it support your claims?
### Evaluating an Argument
1. Coherence - Does the claims make logical sense and it is based on an opinion or supported with evidence. Are assumptions made? Have all the alternatives been considered. 
2. Supporting Evidence - Does the evidence support all the claims, is the evidence appropriate for the topics, is it recent, does it conflict or compliment other evidence, where was it retrieved from, will this causes issues?
**The quality of evidence is dependant upon the quality of the dat and the quality of the interpretation.**
### Etiquette
1. Acknowledge the other person’s view before challenging it.
2. Be constructive rather than simply dismissing the other points of view.
3. Reflect on the strength of the other person’s argument. 
4. Think about your language and whether you risk being offensive before you speak. 
### Objective Phrasing 
<span style="color:red">Do say:</span>.Do say
* "It can be argued..."
* "...tends to..."
* "The evidence suggests..."
* "It has been said..."
<span style="color:red">Do not say:</span>.
* "I..."
* "I think that..."
* "Personally..."
* "It is my personal opinion that..."
### Logical Fallacies 
1. False Dichotomy - Where the speaker forces the debate into two sides when there are more options available. For example, when a colleague tells a team to decide between two HR tools but you know of a third, cheaper, more efficient tool.
2. Assertion - Presenting statements as fact when they may be based on invalid facts or assumptions.
3. Morally Flawed - Going against the code of ethics or morals.
4. Correlation v Causation - Suggesting two events are linked therefore one leads to another.
5. Straw Man - Introducing a weak opposing argument to build up your own argument.
6. Contradiction - Contradicting previous arguments.
7. Comparing conclusions to reality - Considering real world implications of an argument.
### The Art of Persuasion
**Emotion, Respect, Evidence**
### The 3 Pillars of Rhetoric
1. Ethos – Appealing through authority or credibility
2. Pathos – Appealing through emotional empathy 
3. Logos – Appealing through logic and reasoning 
###Key Skills
