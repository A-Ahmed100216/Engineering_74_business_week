My name is Aminah Ahmed and I have recently graduated with a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering.
During my time at university, i attended an event which introduced me to
Industry 4.0 technologies such as Artifical Intelligence, Cloud Computing and Automation. 
This really sparked my interest in the technolgy field so upon graduating
I attneded an academy which gave a basic introduction to In4.0. 
I knew this was a field i wished to pursue a career in so I did my research and I discovered DevOps which was 
a topic which really intrigued me as it encompasses some of the topics i had some experience in and wished to
develop further. I was really pleased to discover Spart Global offer full training in this field because I do
not have the strongest background in this field but i am a fast learner.
