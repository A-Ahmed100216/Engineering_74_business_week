# GDPR
## What it is and why it is important?
* GDPR - General Data Protection Regulations. 
* Came into force May 25th, 2018
* What does it do?
  * Defines what personal data is.
  * Gives all individuals across EU protection for their personal data.
* Even if a company is not based in the EU, they must comply with GDPR if they offer goods or services to citizens in the EU.
* **Why?** 
  * To protect the data of individuals across the EU.

## Key Changes
Data Privacy laws existed prior to 2018 but GDPR ensures much more rigorous and enforced regulations through:
* Increased scope – Applied to any company dealing with individuals who live in the EU.
* Penalties – Large fines for infringement. Categorised in two tiers:
  * Tier 1 - Up to 20 million, or 4% of a company’s annual turnover, whichever is highest.
  * Tier 2 - Up to 10 million, or 2% of a company’s annual turnover, whichever is highest. 
* Consent – The request must be clear and easily accessible, stating what data is required and why? It must also be easy to withdraw consent.

## What constitutes a breach?
There are two types of breaches, a breach of:
1. An individuals rights and freedoms in relation to their data - results in a higher tier of fine.
2. Obligations by the data processor- results in the lower tier fine. 

## Other penalties 
* Warning and reprimands.
* Temporary or permanent ban on data processing.
* Ordering the rectification, restriction or erasure of data. 
* Suspending data transfers to third countries.
* Compensation for damages.

## Who does GDPR apply to?
* Controller - Determines the purpose and means of processing data.  
* Processor - Responsible for processing personal data on behalf of a controller.  

## Types of data 
Data can be categorised as personal or sensitive.
* Personal - Any data that can identity an individual e.g. name, address, email, phone number, D.O.B.
* Sensitive -  Any data which contains sensitive information e.g. health, finances, sexuality, religion etc. 

## What are an Individual's Rights?
An individual holds many rights including the:
* Right to be informed, 
* Right to access, 
* Right to rectification,
* Right to erasure/right to be forgotten,
* Right to restrict processing,
* Right to data portability,
* Right to object,
* Rights related to automated decisions.

## Principles of GDPR
* Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
* Purpose Limitation
* Data Minimisation
* Storage Limitation 
* Integrity and Confidentiality
* Accurate and up-to-date information
* Accountability

## Other Obligations
* Assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO).
* Inform ICO of data breaches within 72 hours.

## Storing and Processing Data 
1. Paper Copies
   Could be lost or damaged so should be kept securely and destroyed when no longer needed. 
2. Emails
   Insecure so could cause a breach 
3. Spreadsheets
   If stored locally, could conflict with the "right to be forgotten".

## Databases
* Remember individuals have the right to access at any time. 
* Do not add comments on a database that you would not be comfortable saying in person.

## Maintaining confidentiality
* Dispose of confidential data safely;
* Protect print outs;
* Password protection and encryption;
* Keep credentials safe – Use MFA;
* Lock your machines;
* Keep a clear desk;
* Avoid storing data on discs or USB.

# Cyber Security
## Why is it important?
* Underpins and protects core functions of every organisation.
* All staff should have some awareness of threats and how to stay safe online.
* Organisation is responsible for securing data and systems, but you are also responsible for maintaining safety measures. 
* Applicable to work and home. 

## Who may be responsible?
Various entities may be responsible with different motives. These may include:
* Online criminals
* Foreign governments
* Hackers – untargeted, agents of chaos
* Political Activists
* Terrorist Organisation
* Malicious Insiders 
* Occasionally someone might just make a mistake. 

## How?
* Phishing - Gathering information via email.
* Vishing -Voice Phising, gathering information via phone calls.
* Smishing - SMS Phishing, phishing via text messages.
* Impersonating
* WaterHoling

Being prone to these attacks may result in loss of confidential information and the installation of malicious software such as:
* Malware - Malicious Software
* Ransomware - Locks your computer and demands money/data in return of control. 

## Social Engineering
Attacks will typically utilise social engineering to do something which may not be in your best interest. This is a type of confidence trick.
6 key principles:
* Reciprocity - Someone doing something for you, you are more likely to return the favour.
* Commitment and Consistency - If people commit to an idea, they are more likely to honour their commitment.
* Social Proof - People will do things that they see others doing.
* Authority - People tend obey authority figures even when asked to do things that seem counter-intuitive.
* Liking - People can be more easily swayed by people they like.
* Scarcity - Perceived scarcity generates demand.

## Countermeasures
* Defend against Phishing - Organisations can introduce technological defences but you should also help by being aware of suspicious emails and reporting them.
* Monitor your digital footprint - This can be scoured by attackers for information. 
  * Check your privacy settings on social platforms.
  * Think about what you post and what it may reveal.
* Secure your devices.
  * Use strong passwords
  * Always lock your laptop
  * Do not give out your passwords
  * Avoid storing data on USBs or discs.
* Internet Usage
  * Do not download external software/content without authorisation
  * Limit your use of the internet to sites and searches appropriate to your job
* Training Employees
* Security Protocols
  * Establish robust policies and procedures
* Event Test
  * Perform unannounced tests such as sending false emails to see where a brach may occur.
* Waste Management
  * Make sure all paper documents are disposed securely e.g. shredding.
* Understanding the importance of reporting
