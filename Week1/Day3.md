# Critical Thinking
## Why?
* Create strong arguments by justifying your claims with evidence you have gathered and evaluated
* Can contribute to any role as it requires the ability to gather info, analyse and evaluate it. 
* Get to the truth- not just trying to win an argument but get to the bottom.
## Key Skills
* Seek out all sides of an argument;
* Check facts and evidence;
* Respond objectively.
## Levels of intellectual skills
* Evaluate – Weigh out both sides and make a decision
* Synthesise – Combine the information and ideas into something new.
* Analyse – Determine the impact.
* Apply – Use knowledge to solve problems.
* Understand – Understand the information.
* Remember- Recall information.
## The Critical Thinking Process
1. Identify:
  * The main points of the argument; 
  * The claims being made;
  * Evidence used;
  * Conclusions reached. 
2. Analyse:
  * Does the information make sense in relation to research;
  * How old is the material;
  * Is the material clear or do you need to find additional information to aid understanding;
  * Does the argument present a balanced view or are some topics disregarded? 
3. Apply:
  * The implications of other information;
  * Weaknesses of your argument when applied to real-life situations;
  * A lack of coverage- Ensure you have covered all the content. 

## Modes of Thinking
There are three mode of thinking:
* Divergent - This focusses upon the question at hand and generates ideas to tackle this. Imagination is at the heart of this mindset.
* Convergent - This focusses upon the facts to present an answer. Logic is at the heart of this mindset.
* Lateral - This is a mixture of both convergent and divergent thinking to achive the best of both worlds and find solutions which are both imaginative and logical.
The thinking hats can also be applied in a critical thinking aspect. To recap:
* White = Facts 
* Yellow = Optimism 
* Black = Judgement
* Red = Emotions
* Green = Creativity
* Blue = Thinking

Conversely, there are incorrect attitudes which prevent us from embracing critical thinking. These are:
1. Ignorant Certainty - The belief that there are definite answers to all questions.
2. Naïve realism- The belief that there is no truth and all arguments are equal.

## What is Enquiry-Based Learning?
* This is the practice of learning by asking questions. 
* Questions can either be open or closed questions:
  * Open - gives the respondant much more freedom in how they respond. Typically, open questions begin with 'how','why','when' etc. 
  * Closed - directs the respondant towards a certain answer. Typically, such questions have a 'yes' or 'no' response. 
The process can be summed up in the following diagram.

## Debating 
### Things to consider
* What is the source of evidence?
* What claims are being made?
Has evidence been provided?
* Is the argument balanced - Strength and weakness?
* Are the points clear and concise?
* What are the underlying themes and background/context?
* Is the argument supported with good examples - Real or imagined examples?
### Structure
The Point, Evidence, Conclusion structure is advised.
1. Point - Present your argument in a clear statement.
2. Evidence - Present evidence to support your claim.
3. Impact - Explain significance of evidence, how does it support your claims?
### Evaluating an Argument
1. Coherence - Does the claims make logical sense and it is based on an opinion or supported with evidence. Are assumptions made? Have all the alternatives been considered. 
2. Supporting Evidence - Does the evidence support all the claims, is the evidence appropriate for the topics, is it recent, does it conflict or compliment other evidence, where was it retrieved from, will this causes issues?

**The quality of evidence is dependant upon the quality of the data and the quality of the interpretation.**
### Etiquette
1. Acknowledge the other person’s view before challenging it.
2. Be constructive rather than simply dismissing the other points of view.
3. Reflect on the strength of the other person’s argument. 
4. Think about your language and whether you risk being offensive before you speak. 
### Objective Phrasing 
Do say:
* "It can be argued..."
* "...tends to..."
* "The evidence suggests..."
* "It has been said..."

Do not say:
* "I..."
* "I think that..."
* "Personally..."
* "It is my personal opinion that..."
### Logical Fallacies 
1. False Dichotomy - Where the speaker forces the debate into two sides when there are more options available. For example, when a colleague tells a team to decide between two HR tools but you know of a third, cheaper, more efficient tool.
2. Assertion - Presenting statements as fact when they may be based on invalid facts or assumptions.
3. Morally Flawed - Going against the code of ethics or morals.
4. Correlation v Causation - Suggesting two events are linked therefore one leads to another.
5. Straw Man - Introducing a weak opposing argument to build up your own argument.
6. Contradiction - Contradicting previous arguments.
7. Comparing conclusions to reality - Considering real world implications of an argument.
### The Art of Persuasion
**Emotion, Respect, Evidence**
### The 3 Pillars of Rhetoric
1. Ethos – Appealing through authority or credibility
2. Pathos – Appealing through emotional empathy 
3. Logos – Appealing through logic and reasoning 
### Key Skills
It is important to keep your arguments relevant and objective. Support with evidence and examples. Consider your audience and their attention span.

Do:
* Be prepared;
* Stay calm;
* Speak clearly and concisely;
* Use simple langauge - avoid jargon;
* Active listening.

Don't:
* Falsify or alter evidence;
* Publicly disagree with the decision;
* Make it personal - don't attack the speaker;
* Act aggressively or offensively;
* Interrupt others;
* Disagree with facts or obvious truths.

**Remember it is ok to make mistakes, as long as you admit to them.** It is also ok to agree with the opposite side.


# Project Environments
## Project Vs BAU
BAU = Business as Usual. This refers to the standard practices you do every day. The normal execution of standard operations within an organisation.

Project = Unique and transient with a desired outcome and set stages. These are:

   Initiation --> Planning --> Execution --> Monitoring and Control --> Close

## Triple Constraints
There are 3 main factors which influence a factor: Time, Quality and Cost. These are defined in the POPIT model. It is important to find a balance between the three.

## Benefits of Good Project Management:
* Efficient use of time;
* Good delivery;
* High standard;
* Overall satisfaction;
* People working on project are less stressed.

## Software development methodologies or lifecycles include:
* Agile - Methodology used in development environments. Utilises an iterative approach where you do, deisgn and check. 
* Waterfall - Logical progression, one after the other. Quite an outdated methodology. 
* System's V - Similar logical progression as agile but more modern.
### Scrum and agile
Agile is a methodology whereas Scrum is a framework used within an agile environment. Trello is a popular scrum tool.

## Working in teams
A mature team has several attributes:
* Co-located;
* Cross functional roles;
* Self-organising;
* Accountable and empowered;
* Test and learn feedback loops.

Roles in a team include:
BA = Business Analyst;
PM = Project Manager;
DEV = Developers;
QA = Quality Assurance;
UX = User Interfaces.

Projects are difficult so several steps can be implemented to address this:
* Create a positive environment;
* Manage conflict intelligently;
* Have open and clear communication;
* Respect all of your peers;
* Become trustworthy.
 
## Essential Project Knowledge 
Business Cases - A justification for the proposed project needed to obtain authorisation from the Board
This includes aspects such as:
1. Expected benefits; 
2. Timeline;
3. Summary;
4. Investment appraisal;
5. Solutions/options;
6. Major risks; 
7. Stakeholders/Communication plan.

### Stakeholders
Anyone connected to the company with an invested interest. Stakeholders can be customers, partners, suppliers, regulator, employers, managers, owners, or competitors.  
The attitude of a stakeholder is an important parameter to gauge. They may be:
1. Champion - Fight for your cause.
2. Supporter - Speak favourably on your behalf.
3. Neutral - Not your biggest advocate, but not a critic either.
4. Opponent - Against the project.
5. Blocker - Actively against, may create problems.

Typcially, stakeholders are driven by ROI, a return on investment. The money you put in, you expect to get out. It is important to identify this because it comes down to the worth of the product to people who need it.


## Risk
Risk is a key factor in any project as events can derail the entire project so it is important to idenitfy potential sources of concern and mitigate against them so as to minimise disruption. 
Sources of risk include:
* Technology;
* Team;
* Scope;
* Business;
* Economy;
* Competition.

Risk can be dealt by:
* Avoidance;
* Transfer;
* Reduce;
* Accept.


# What is DevOps?
DevOps combines the roles of developers and operation teams.
Developers are responsible for tasks such as implementing new product features, fixing bugs, ensuring security etc. These are then deployed into build environments to check integration. But a build environment is not fully reflective of the production environment so deployment can be problematic.
Operations are responsible for running servers, monitoring and growing capaicty.
Combining the two allows the two to share responsibility, deploy infrastructure as a code and automate the pipeline.
This leads to an array of benefits including:
* Greater Efficiency;
* Good engineering practices;
* Continous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CICD);
* Faster time to market;
* Improved collaboration;
* Continuous release cycles;
* Automated deployment therein leading to better quality.
