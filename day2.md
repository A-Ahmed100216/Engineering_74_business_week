# Time and Task Management
Time Management- A range of skills, tools, and techniques to accomplish specific tasks, projects and goals.

## The Pareto Principle
* Coined after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto
* 80% of effects arise from 20% of causes. 
* 80/20 ratio present in various fields and aspects of life. For example:
  * 20% of people supposedly own 80% of the world's wealth.
* Importance? It's easy to focus on the larger tasks but overlooking smaller tasks may lead to them accumulating and becoming an issue, thus 20% of tasks may lead to 80% issues.

## Eisenhower Priniple 
* Named after President Eisenhower who famously said "I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."
* Decision matrix enables you to categorise tasks according to their importance and urgency. 
* Important tasks are typically ones which help you own goals whether they are professional or personal.
* Urgent tasks are usually tasks which help other reach their goals, i.e. a business. These require immediate attention.
* The overall aim of this is to make efficient use of our time.
